# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal is to transform and analyze data in SQL based on the ecommerce database, summarizing key points from multiple tables.

## Process
1. Started with cleaning the data.
2. Answered the questions to the best of my ability
3. Create new questions with the database
4. QA my data

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
Sorting and cleaning the data was confusing and hard to get started. Importing such a large dataset meant that there were tons of missing/NULL values and there was a lot of 'noise'. The 'data type' was confusing to determine and there were many columns that seemed redundant.

Having many different tables with very similar type of data, with ambiguous overall table names, means that it can be very hard to decipher which tables are the correct tables to be pulling the data from.

--- e.g. units_sold in Analytics VS total_ordered in sales_by_sku VS orderedQuantity in Products

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I think having a cleaner dataset would be incredibly helpful to simplify and prep for analysis. Also, I would develop a better QA process to match and verify the data from two different tables.
