# Transforming and Analyzing Data With SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal is to transform and analyze data in SQL based on an imported ecommerce database, summarizing key points from multiple tables.

## Process
1. Importing the data
2. Cleaning
3. Review starter questions with queries
4. Brainstorm and create new questions with queries
5. QA Process

## Results
The database was able to provide necessary information on analytics on the orders and furthermore onto demographics. I found that the Sport Bottle was the top selling product. However, further analysis showed that this product was only the 4th most profitable item by total revenue.
The Nest Cameras (both Outdoor and Indoor) were only 3rd and 4th best selling, but generated the most revenue, likely due to their higher unit price.

## Challenges 
Sorting and cleaning the data was confusing and hard to get started. Importing such a large dataset meant that there were tons of missing/NULL values and there was a lot of 'noise'. The 'data type' was confusing to determine and there were many columns that seemed redundant.

Having many different tables with very similar type of data, with ambiguous overall table names, means that it can be very hard to decipher which tables are the correct tables to be pulling the data from.

--- e.g. units_sold in Analytics VS total_ordered in sales_by_sku VS orderedQuantity in Products

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I think having a cleaner dataset would be incredibly helpful to simplify and prep for analysis. Also, I would develop a better QA process to match and verify the data from two different tables.
